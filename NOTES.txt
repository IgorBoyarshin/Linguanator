
Words have ids because it is a pain in the ass to update the whole databse after a word removal(affecst connections).
Languages are not. So they don't have ids.

##### For development:
    (Using live reloading)

    >> npm run serve

    Starts a webpack's webpack-dev-server on 8080
    Using style-loader and css-loader takes all css files, injects them into the
    html(not the file, but in memory).


##### For deployent:

    Using npm, copy the styles.css file into the dist folder manually.

    npm run build_f:prod

    [BTW]: can remove the copying of the css file now(gets injected with import anyway)
